## The Import Workaround
I don't know why Github Actions won't modify the files. I kept struggling with npm until I somehow found that something *was* happening... just somewhere else. So the files on the runner, which wouldn't push, were uploaded as artifacts. Hooray. If anyone who happens to look here (probably no one other than myself) has a fix for this behaviour, it would definitely help to update paper.js easier.
